## MWget
MWget is a "MultiLine" wget for all POSTX System! The original package can be downloaded from [here](http://jaist.dl.sourceforge.net/project/kmphpfm/mwget/0.1/mwget_0.1.0.orig.tar.bz2).

It seems that the original package had some problems of missing "#include<...>" code when compiling on relatively new POSTX System. I fix those problems that I encounter and make this repository.
